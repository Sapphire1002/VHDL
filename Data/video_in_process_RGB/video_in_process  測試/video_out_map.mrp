  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 8 - Guide Report

Sat Dec 01 14:20:25 2018

  Estimated SmartGuide Results
  ----------------------------
  This section describes the guide results after placement. Re-implemented 
  components are components that were guided, but moved in order to satisfy
  timing requirements.

    Estimated Percentage of guided Components                 |  90.0%
    Estimated Percentage of re-implemented Components         |   1.5%
    Estimated Percentage of new/changed Components            |   8.5%
    Estimated Percentage of fully guided Nets                 |  67.4%
    Estimated Percentage of partially guided or unrouted Nets |  32.6%

  A detailed SmartGuide report (.GRF) can be generated during PAR by
  specifying the [-smartguide <guidefile[.ncd]>] switch on the PAR
  command line. The GRF file contains all components and nets that were
  not guided. A final summary report is always generated and is available
  in the PAR report file and in the GRF regardless of the PAR -smartguide switch.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
